# 📁 Understanding File Extensions (.html)

## 🔹 What is a File Extension?

A **file extension** tells the computer **what type of file it is**.

Example:

```
index.html
```

👉 `.html` = HTML file

## 🔹 Why `.html` is Important?

* Browser recognizes it as a **webpage**
* Without `.html`, browser won’t read HTML code

## 🔹 Common HTML File Names

```
index.html
about.html
contact.html
```

## 🔹 What Happens if Extension is Wrong?

- ✅ `index.html` → Opens in browser

## 🔹 How Browser Uses `.html`
