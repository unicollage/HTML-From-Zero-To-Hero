# 🌐 How Does a Website Work?

1. **User types a website URL** in the browser
   Example: `www.example.com`

2. **Browser sends request** to the server
   (Server = computer where website files are stored)

3. **Server responds** with website files

   * HTML
   * CSS
   * JavaScript

4. **Browser reads HTML first**
   It builds the structure of the webpage

5. **CSS is applied**
   Adds colors, layout, and design

6. **JavaScript runs**
   Adds interaction and logic

7. **Website is displayed** on the screen
